# Lost in the desert 

## In this assignment I have created an interactive story where the user suddenly ends up in a desert in the middle of nowhere. You as the user now set out to explore and find out what happened!

*The user starts the game by typing "start game" in the input field.* 

#### Throughout the story different options are presented to the user. To continue the story the user needs to type the exact letters and cases as they are presented to continue.

There are different paths that the user can take. There are also two different ways to reach an ending. To restart the game when an ending is reached: simply type "start game".
